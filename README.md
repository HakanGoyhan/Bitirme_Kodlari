# Autonomous Sorting System and Product Recognition Project

## About the Project

Developed as part of the ELE495 Final Design Project, this project is an autonomous system that automatically recognizes and counts products passing on a conveyor belt. The product recognition process is carried out using an artificial intelligence algorithm developed with Nvidia Jetson Nano, and the results are transmitted to a mobile phone application via Bluetooth. The system is designed to meet critical performance criteria such as the speed and accuracy of the product recognition process.

### Technologies Used

- **Nvidia Jetson Nano**: For running the artificial intelligence algorithm.
- **Arduino Uno**: For controlling the conveyor belt and processing sensor data.
- **HC-05 Bluetooth Module**: Provides wireless communication for transferring data to the mobile application.
- **HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor**: Detects products placed on the conveyor belt.
- **Nema-17 Stepper Motor & TB6600 Motor Driver**: Powers the movement of the conveyor belt.
- **Everest SC-HD03 USB Camera**: Captures images of the products.

### Features

- **Autonomous Operation**: The system detects products placed on the conveyor belt, stops the belt, captures a photo of the product with the camera, and performs the recognition process.
- **Real-Time Data Transmission**: The number and variety of recognized products are transmitted to the mobile application via the Bluetooth module and presented to the user.
- **High Accuracy**: The artificial intelligence model, trained with our own dataset, can recognize various fruits with high accuracy.
